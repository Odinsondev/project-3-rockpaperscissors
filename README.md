# project-3-rockpaperscissors
My third Odin project - Rock Paper Scissors

Assignment overview:

I'm going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. For the moment I'm just going to play the game from the browser console, but I will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text.
